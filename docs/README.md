# ðŸª„ Sorcery ðŸª„

Sorcery is my hobby game engine that I use to play around with new hardware features and graphics algorithms. The aim is to eventually make it a complete toolset for video game creation, but in its current state, it's more of a close integration of ideas.

## Gallery 
Some screenshots from Sorcery's editor, Mage!

  * Deferred rendering
    * Thin G-buffer for deferred lighting and screen space effects
  * PBR material system using Cook-Torrance BRDF
    * Albedo, metallic, roughness, ao, and normal values/maps, alpha clipping support
  * Directional, spot, and pointlights
  * Cascaded Shadow Maps for directional lights
    * Customizable split distances
    * Stabilized projection
  * Dynamic spot and pointlight shadow resolution
    * Screen-coverage based allocation from shadow atlas
  * PCF Tent filtering on shadow maps
  * Depth and normal shadow bias
